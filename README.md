- 👋 Hi, I’m @Zhaudihen
- 👀 I’m interested in game development, game writing and design!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create narrative games on Twine, worldbuild, and develop my game writing skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that are happy to involve a beginner game writer such as myself.
